Hyde-SB
======

A simple [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme intended for use on my [personal website](http://www.stephanbaker.com).  This repository simply serves as a place to record my changes in version control.

This theme is a modified version of [hyde-x](https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x/), which is a port of the original [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme.
